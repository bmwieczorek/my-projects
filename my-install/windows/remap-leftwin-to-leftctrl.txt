For remapping any physical key on the keyboard is a registry entry.

It's in [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
You create a key with the name Scancode Map. It can redirect any key to another key or disable it.

That key is a hex-value with the following meaning:

00,00,00,00 Header: Version. Set to all zeroes.
00,00,00,00 Header: Flags. Set to all zeroes.
05,00,00,00 5 entries in the map (including null entry).
38,00,1d,00 Left CTRL -> Left ALT (can also be another key).
1d,00,38,00 Left ALT -> Left CTRL.
38,e0,1d,e0 Right CTRL -> Right ALT.
1d,e0,38,e0 Right ALT -> Right CTRL.
00,00,00,00 Null entry.
To swap the CTRL and ALT keys you need four entries (plus null).
The Left Left-CTRL (1d 00), the Left Left-ALT (38 00), the Right-CTRL (1d e0), and the Right-ALT (38 e0).

So you can create a .reg file like this: Disable_CTRL-key.reg

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,05,00,00,00,38,00,1d,00,1d,00,38,00,38,e0,1d,e0,1d,e0,38,e0,00,00,00,00
Execute (double click) the .reg file and log out and back in (or restart your computer). Now your CTRL and ALT keys should have been swapped.

Other useful keys to know:

1d 00    Left Ctrl
1d e0    Right Ctrl
38 00    Left Alt
38 e0    Right Alt
5b e0    Left Windows Key
5c e0    Right Windows Key
5d e0    Windows Menu Key
If you are not comfortable with changing the registry or you want other keys too you can use the program SharpKeys to edit them more easily. It also has a convenient list of all keys so you can just add them in a window.
